  storytext: You enter a narrow hallway, the damp stone walls echoing your footsteps.
    A faint, musty smell hangs in the air. At the end of the corridor, you see a
    dimly lit chamber with a peculiar chest resting against the far wall. Its golden
    exterior glistens enticingly, but a chill runs down your spine. Will you approach
    it?
