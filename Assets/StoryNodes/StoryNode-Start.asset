  storytext: You find yourself at the entrance of a dimly lit dungeon. The cold stone
    walls are adorned with strange markings that seem to shift in the flickering
    torchlight. Ahead of you are three hallways, each leading to a different room.
    Your adventurer's instincts are sharp, but a sense of unease lingers in the air.
    Which way will you go?
