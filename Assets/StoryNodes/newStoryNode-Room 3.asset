  storytext: The air is thick with tension as you enter this room. The walls are
    adorned with haunting paintings of treasure hunters, their faces twisted in expressions
    of terror. In the center of the room, a massive chest sits, its lid slightly
    ajar, beckoning you with promises of fortune.
