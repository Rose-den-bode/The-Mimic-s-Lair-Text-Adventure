  storytext: As you explore the corners of the entrance, you notice a slight indentation
    in the wall. Curious, you press against it, and a hidden passage opens up. You
    step into a small, dimly lit chamber filled with old relics and a faint glow
    emanating from a pedestal at the center. It feels ancient, filled with untold
    stories.
